- name: Hydroclimatic variability and dynamics
  description: "There is a high degree of uncertainty in future hydroclimatic changes due to the range of scales
  required to simulate precipitation in models and the uncertainty inherent in a complex climate. My work aims
  to understand the sources  of this uncertainty (both modeled and real-world) using paleo-reconstructions,
  instrumental observations, and models to improve prediction of the range of hydroclimatic outcomes this
  coming century. As part of this, I investigate and diagnose the dynamics of low-frequency modes of hydroclimatic
  variability and identify their consequences for the land surface moisture balance. Current projects include a focus on
  full-column soil moisture in the Southwest US and persistent drought risks in forced versus unforced climates."

- name: Human impacts of climate change
  description: " Translating the range of outcomes in physical climate impacts is insufficient to understand what such impacts imply for people
  and the systems they value. For example, snow is projected to melt in a warmer world, but the human impacts of less snow depends on where and how
  people use snow to supply water for human consumption. The aim of this work is to incorporate other sciences, both social and natural, to translate physical
  climate impacts into impacts on humans. Current projects include risks of declines in future water availability given human water demand, a bottom-up
  (sector-based impacts) approach to identifing correlated climate extremes."

- name: Adaptation decision-making
  description: "We know that model-simulated internal variability induced by the atmosphere is sufficient to mask, amplify,
  or reverse the direction of anthropogenically-forced trends in temperature, circulation, and precipitation
  at large spatial and temporal scales, complicating adaptation decisions. Characterizing the most likely climate outcome is not sufficient for planning.
  Rather, quantifying the full extent of outcomes from internal variability under global warming is key to
  enable adaptation in the face of uncertain climate change threats. Robust decision-making under
  uncertainty requires the identification of adaptations that produce benefits under the broadest range
  of outcomes from internal variability. This area of research aims to enable climate risk management and robust decision-making by incorporating these tools into climate
  science questions. Current projects include identification of the time of emergence and distribution of benefits of agricultural adaptation."
