- name: Hydroclimatic uncertainty
  description: "There is a high degree of uncertainty in future hydroclimatic changes due to the range of scales 
  required to simulate precipitation in models and the uncertainty inherent in a complex climate. My work aims to understand the sources 
  of this uncertainty (both modeled and real-world) using paleorecords, instrumental observations, and models to improve prediction
  of the range of hydroclimatic outcomes this coming century."

- name: Human impacts of climate change
  description: " Translating the range of outcomes in physical climate impacts is insufficient to understand what such impacts imply for people
  and the systems they value. The aim of this work is to incorporate other sciences, both social and natural, to translate physical
  climate impacts into impacts on humans."

- name: Adaptation decision-making
  description: "We know that model-simulated internal variability induced by the atmosphere is sufficient to mask, amplify, 
  or reverse the direction of anthropogenically-forced trends in temperature, circulation, and precipitation 
  at large spatial and temporal scales, complicating adaptation decisions. Characterizing the most likely climate outcome is not sufficient for planning. 
  Rather, quantifying the full extent of outcomes from internal variability under global warming is key to
  enable adaptation in the face of uncertain climate change threats. Robust decision-making under
  uncertainty requires the identification of adaptations that produce benefits under the broadest range
  of outcomes from internal variability. This project aims to enable climate risk management and robust decision-making by incorporating these tools into climate
  science questions."
