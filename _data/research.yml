- name: Hydroclimatic variability and dynamics
  description: "What combinations of low- and high-frequency ocean-atmopshere
  variability generate droughts? Our work aims to understand the forcings of
  hydroclimatic variability using paleoclimate data, instrumental observations,
  and models. As part of this, we investigate and diagnose the drivers
  of historical hydroclimate changes and the consequences for terrestrial climate and hydrology
  â€” from low-frequency modes of internal variability to vegetation-atmosphere interactions.
  Current projects include examination of modes of variability and the land surface
  in shaping historical drought events and the drivers of persistent drought risks
  in forced versus unforced climates."

- name: Model diagnosis and evaluation
  description: "How well do models simulate the real-world Earth system processes we care about
  and what are the model schemes responsible for structural uncertainties in such processes?
  There is a high degree of uncertainty in future climate changes, for example,
  due to the range of scales required to simulate things like
  precipitation and turbulent fluxes in models and the uncertainty inherent in a complex climate.
  Our work aims to understand the sources of model response uncertainty and constrain
  such uncertainty using data-model comparisons to improve model fidelity (and the
  prediction of the range of climate outcomes this coming century).
  Current projects include the role of land surface schemes and assumptions (pariticualry vegetation
  and snow) on hydroclimate and hydrology."

- name: Human and ecosystem impacts of climate change
  description: "Translating the range of outcomes in physical climate impacts is
  insufficient to understand what such impacts imply for people and the systems
  they value. For example, snow is projected to melt in a warmer world, but the
  human impacts of reduced snowpack depends on where and how people use snow.
  The aim of this work is to incorporate other
  sciences, both social and natural, to translate physical climate impacts into
  impacts on people and ecosystems. Current projects include an examination of
  the risks of declines in future water availability given human water demands
  and reconciling top-down and bottom-up approaches to identifing climate-driven
  impacts on agriculture."

- name: Adaptation decision-making
  description: "We know that model-simulated internal variability is sufficient
  to mask, amplify, or reverse the direction of
  anthropogenically-forced trends in temperature, circulation, and precipitation
  at large spatial and temporal scales, complicating adaptation decisions.
  Characterizing the most likely climate outcome is not sufficient for planning.
  Rather, quantifying the full extent of outcomes from internal variability under
  global warming is key to enable robust adaptation in the face of uncertain climate
  threats. Current projects include identification of the time of emergence and
  distribution of benefits of adaptations."
