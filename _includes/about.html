                  I am a climate scientist and an <a href="http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/55" target='_blank'>Earth Institute Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University</a>, jointly appointed by <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu" target='_blank'>Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory</a> and <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov" target='_blank'>NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies</a>.
                </p>
                  <p>
                  I was recently appointed as an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://geography.dartmouth.edu/people/justin-s-mankin" target='_blank'>Department of Geography</a> at <a href="http://dartmouth.edu" target='_blank'>Dartmouth College</a>, beginning in July 2018. </p>
                  <p> 
                    I am actively recruiting postdocs and graduate students. If you are interested in joining the lab, <a href="mailto:mankin@dartmouth.edu">please contact me.</a>

                  My research aims to constrain the uncertainty essential to understanding and responding to climate changeâ€™s impacts on people and ecosystems. My previous career was as an intelligence officer working in South Asia and the Middle East. I am from Vermont and I hold degrees from Columbia University (BA, MPA), the London School of Economics (MSc), and Stanford University (PhD). <!-- live in Nyack, NY, with my wife <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/anthropology/cgi-bin/web/?q=node/645" target='_blank'>Maron Greenleaf</a> and my daughter Halilee.Working on water, I focus on three of the major sources of uncertainty in climate impacts assessments: the chaos of the climate system, the complexity of how people respond to climate stress, and how model choices influence our predictions of climate risks.
                  I hope my research can help inform the adaptation and risk management decisions people undertake in response to the uncertain threats from climate change. This requires advances in both basic and applied climate science, to include the integration of risk management, economics, and the communication of uncertainty.-->
