                      I am an interdisciplinary climate scientist and an Earth Institute Postdoctoral Fellow. I am jointly appointed by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
                      My research aims to constrain the uncertainty essential to understanding and responding to climate changeâ€™s impacts on people. I focus on two of the major sources of uncertainty in climate impacts assessments: the chaos of the climate system and the complexity of how people respond to climate stress.
                      I hope my research can help inform the adaptation and risk management decisions people undertake in response to the uncertain threats from climate change. This requires I make advances in both basic and applied climate science, to include the integration of risk management, economics, and the communication of uncertainty.
                      Prior to the academy, I served as an intelligence officer. I holds degrees from Columbia University (BA, MPA), the London School of Economics (MSc), and Stanford University (PhD).
