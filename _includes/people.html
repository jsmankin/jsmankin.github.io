                <a href="mailto:Corey.S.Lesk@dartmouth.edu">Corey Lesk (he/him)</a> is a <a href="https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/funding/faculty/postdoctoral-fellows" target="_blank">Neukom Postdoctoral Fellow</a> and a <a href="https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/program/scholarships-2nd-and-3rd-cycle-2022-2023/" target="_blank"> Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies (FRQNT) Fellow</a> in the Climate Modeling & Impacts Group. He is an environmental scientist interested in climate change and its impacts on people and nature. During his PhD at <a href="https://eesc.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>, he studied how weather has affected food crops historically, drawing lessons to help adapt agriculture to a more extreme climate. He also assessed the greenhouse gas emissions likely to result from the climate transition. Corey is investigating how rising atmospheric carbon dioxide may change how crops and natural vegetation interact with climate extremes. His research integrates diverse observational data with biophysical and statistical models. Corey is also an enthusiastic environmental and climate educator.
