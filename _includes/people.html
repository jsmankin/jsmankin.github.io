He is an environmental scientist interested in climate change and its impacts on people and nature. During his PhD at <a href="https://eesc.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>, he studied how weather has affected food crops historically, drawing lessons to help adapt agriculture to a more extreme climate. He also assessed the greenhouse gas emissions likely to result from the climate transition. Corey is investigating how rising atmospheric carbon dioxide may change how crops and natural vegetation interact with climate extremes. His research integrates diverse observational data with biophysical and statistical models. Corey is also an enthusiastic environmental and climate educator.

She earned a BE in <a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/academics/undergraduate/ab/modified/environmental">Environmental Engineering</a> from Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth. She is originally from Bell, California and it was her upbringing in the LA County that ultimately influenced her interest in the environment. She has research experience analyzing the environmental impacts of microplastics in polar regions as well as conducting Life Cycle Assessments for commercial products. Emily has since developed a passion for understanding climate change and the impact air pollution has on the environment. Outside of academics, she was a part of the <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~triathlon/?DB_OEM_ID=11610#page-top">Dartmouth Triathlon Team</a> and competes in both short and long-distance triathlons.</p>
